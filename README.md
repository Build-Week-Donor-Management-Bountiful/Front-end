-create a new campaign for organization
-create a new donor 
-update donor information including the data last contacted and/or contact information
-keep track of funding goal and amount raised for campaigns


(10/24/19) Backend is not completed yet, so the donors and campaigns are filled with dummy data until the backend is completed. Users can still interact with the app but nothing will be saved besides the username, password and user is. Meaning if a user signs up, the user credidentials (username, id, password) will be saved in database. Changes made to user's account such as username, password, or even deleting the user account will be permament!
